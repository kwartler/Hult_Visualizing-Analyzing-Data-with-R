### For Mac users trying to install git, you need to install BREW first from here

[Brew](https://brew.sh/)
Terminal code: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

Once downloaded you will need to copy paste two lines that are printed in console and execute them.  then you have to type 
`brew install git` in terminal.
